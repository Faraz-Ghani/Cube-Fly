## What it does
You have to avoid pipes by Flapping your birds and stay alive
## How we built it
I used Unity Engine based on C#.
## Challenges we ran into
Perfecting the pipes spawning and background loop were quite the challenge
## What's next for CubeFly
There is nothing in the future for CubeFly besides maybe adding a score Counter.
